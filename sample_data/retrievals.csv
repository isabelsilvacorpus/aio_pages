Why it's a Good Investment (Pros):
Strong Appreciation History: NeighborhoodScout notes Madison's historically high appreciation rates, placing it in the top 20% nationally over the last decade, with recent trends still showing positive growth.

dd080aae-5895-475e-9f9b-1a19cdeb0188,1,"Tazewell, TN offers a potentially good real estate investment for those seeking affordability, small-town charm, natural beauty (near Norris Lake), and a slower pace, with rising home values and relatively quick sales. However, investors should balance this with local economic growth potential (which is slower than major cities) and be mindful of higher crime rates compared to national averages, making it ideal for lifestyle investors rather than rapid appreciation seekers.
Pros for Real Estate Investment:
Affordable Living: Tazewell boasts a low cost of living and affordable housing, making it attractive for retirees, families, and budget-conscious buyers.
Rising Home Values: Home values have been increasing, with Zillow showing a 3.3% year-over-year rise and Homes.com noting an 11% jump in median sale prices over the last year.
Quick Sales: Homes sell faster in Tazewell (around 47 days) than the national average (53 days).
Lifestyle Appeal: Strong community, natural scenery, and proximity to Norris Lake and hiking trails attract outdoor enthusiasts, potentially boosting rental demand.
Gateway to Larger Cities: Convenient highway access to Knoxville and Morristown offers access to larger job markets.
Cons & Considerations:
Slower Economic Growth: While peaceful, the area lacks the rapid economic development of larger Tennessee cities, which could limit high-end appreciation.
Crime Rates: Both Nextdoor and NeighborhoodScout data indicate Tazewell's crime rates (property and violent) are higher than both state and national averages, a key factor for rental property owners.
Niche Market: It's a lifestyle market focused on rural living, not a booming tech or business hub, so investment returns might be steadier and less dramatic.
Verdict:Tazewell, TN is a solid choice for investors targeting long-term rentals, vacation homes (due to lake access), or buying for personal use in a low-cost, scenic area. It's less suited for quick flips or high-growth speculative plays.

Key Takeaways:
Generally Safe: Sources like LullaPanda describe Benton as having ""low crime rates and strong sense of community,"" drawing families.
Property Crime Focus: While violent crime seems low, Niche data indicates higher rates for property crimes like theft and burglary (relative to its small population), with theft at 2,042.8 per capita and burglary at 500.1, per Niche.
Small Town Dynamics: Augurisk lists Benton with moderate property risk and low violent risk, noting potential high socioeconomic risks, but its small population (832) can skew per-capita statistics, says Niche and Augurisk.
Rural Feel: It's described as rural, with most residents owning homes and a conservative leaning, suggesting a tight-knit community where basic safety awareness (like not walking alone late at night) is key, according to Niche and LullaPanda: Child Photo Contest.

Average & Median Wages in Ekalaka:
Median Annual Salary: Around $52,000.
Typical Range (25th-75th Percentile): $41,800 to $59,300.
Highest Paying Industries: Public Administration (avg. ~$58k) and Construction (avg. ~$33k).
What Makes a ""Good"" Salary (Context Matters):
Living Wage: A single adult in Montana needs over $22/hour to meet basic needs, and more for families, making a $50k salary potentially tight.
Household Income: The median household income in Ekalaka is lower than the state average, suggesting many rely on lower incomes.
Cost of Living: While Ekalaka is small, rural living costs can be high, especially for healthcare, groceries, and transportation in Eastern Montana.
To Live Comfortably:
$50,000 - $60,000: Likely covers basic needs but leaves little room for savings or luxuries.
