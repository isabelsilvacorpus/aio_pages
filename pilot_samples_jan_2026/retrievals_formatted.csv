Key Details:
Natural Fluoride: San Antonio water naturally contains some fluoride (around 0.3 ppm) from the Trinity Aquifer.
Added Fluoride: SAWS adds more to reach the optimal range, as recommended by dental health experts.

3b75f149-38a3-454f-ad7d-fc8763cd24fc,1,"The real estate transfer tax in Ringgold, Georgia, is a state-imposed tax calculated based on the property's sale price, not a separate local tax. The rate is uniform across Georgia.
Tax Rate and Calculation
The tax rate is applied to the full value of the property being conveyed, minus any existing liens not removed by the sale.
$1.00 for the first $1,000 or fractional part of $1,000.
$0.10 for each additional $100 or fractional part of $100.
This works out to approximately $1 per $1,000 of the sale price.
Example:For a home sold for $300,000, the transfer tax would be calculated as:
$1 for the first $1,000
$299,000 remaining value (2,990 additional $100 increments)
2,990 increments * $0.10 = $299
Total Tax: $300.
Payment and Responsibility
The tax must be paid to the Clerk of the Superior Court in Catoosa County (where Ringgold is located) before the deed or transfer instrument can be recorded.
The seller is primarily liable for the tax, although the buyer and seller can agree in the sales contract that the buyer will pay it.
Payment is often handled during the real estate closing process by the closing agent or title company, who then remits it to the county official.
Other Potential Taxes
When a home sale involves a long-term note (a loan with a maturity greater than three years), an additional Intangible Recording Tax may be due. This tax is $1.50 per each $500 of the loan amount (or $3.00 per thousand). This tax also is collected by the Clerk of Superior Court.

Lifestyle Appeal: Proximity to beaches, historical charm, and a good quality of life attract retirees and vacationers, supporting demand.
Strong Regional Growth: It's part of a booming Coastal Delaware market known for property value appreciation.

Automotive Hub: Its role as a major auto manufacturing center fueled 20th-century growth and attracted diverse immigrants.
Transportation: A crucial railroad and port center, linking the East and West.
Labor & Social Movements
Militant Labor: The 1934 Auto-Lite Strike was a landmark event, a large-scale urban uprising that helped launch the militant industrial labor movement and led to union recognition.
